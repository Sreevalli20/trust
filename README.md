# TrustAI – Explainable AI Framework for Banking

## Description
**TrustAI** is an advanced **Explainable AI (XAI) framework** designed specifically for the banking sector.  
The project addresses the growing need for **transparency, fairness, and trust** in AI-driven banking operations.  

Traditional AI models in banking are often **opaque**, leaving customers and regulators unsure about how decisions are made. TrustAI bridges this gap by providing:

- **Clear, natural-language explanations** of AI decisions such as credit scoring, fraud detection, and personalized offers.
- **Customer control over their data**, allowing users to opt-in or opt-out of specific uses dynamically.
- **Governance features**, including simulated audit logs and fairness checks to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements.

TrustAI ensures that both **bank customers and financial institutions** can trust AI decisions, while also enabling **faster AI adoption** in banking systems.
